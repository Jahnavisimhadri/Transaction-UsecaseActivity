# Bank-Usecase-Activity
 This is a C# usecase-activity where the transaction details of Bank customers are accepted through a Form called FORM1.
In that the fields are account-ID,account-NAME and the amount they deposited or withdrawn. 
By accepting the details of the user and upon clicking the "TRANSFER" button the amount is transferred to their accounts.
The amount is deducted from the available balance and the remaining balance along with other details is shown in the form of Database table.
The usage of C# tools like buttons,labels,textboxes (for User details insertion) along with datagridview to maintain the records in the form of table is done here.
We used the softwares like Visual Studio to develop the web Application forms and Microsoft SQL management studio for database connectivity.
